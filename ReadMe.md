# Data Warehousing for Business Intelligence Specialization

Evaluate business needs, design a data warehouse, and integrate and visualize data using dashboards and visual
analytics.

This Specialization covers data architecture skills that are increasingly critical across a broad range of technology
fields. You’ll learn the basics of structured data modeling, gain practical SQL coding experience, and develop an
in-depth understanding of data warehouse design and data manipulation. You’ll have the opportunity to work with large
data sets in a data warehouse environment to create dashboards and Visual Analytics. You will use of MicroStrategy, a
leading BI tool, OLAP (online analytical processing) and Visual Insights capabilities to create dashboards and Visual
Analytics. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to build a small, basic data warehouse, populate it
with data, and create dashboards and other visualizations to analyze and communicate the data to a broad audience.

## Courses:

### 1. Database Management Essentials

Database Management Essentials provides the foundation you need for a career in database development, data warehousing,
or business intelligence, as well as for the entire Data Warehousing for Business Intelligence specialization. In this
course, you will create relational databases, write SQL statements to extract information to satisfy business reporting
requests, create entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) to design databases, and analyze table designs for excessive
redundancy. As you develop these skills, you will use either Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL to execute SQL statements and
a database diagramming tool such as the ER Assistant or Visual Paradigm to create ERDs. We’ve designed this course to
ensure a common foundation for specialization learners. Everyone taking the course can jump right in with writing SQL
statements in Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.

### 2. Data Warehouse Concepts, Design, and Data Integration

In this course, you will learn exciting concepts and skills for designing data warehouses and creating data integration
workflows. These are fundamental skills for data warehouse developers and administrators. You will have hands-on
experience for data warehouse design and use open source products for manipulating pivot tables and creating data
integration workflows. In the data integration assignment, you can use either Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL databases.
You will also gain conceptual background about maturity models, architectures, multidimensional models, and management
practices, providing an organizational perspective about data warehouse development. If you are currently a business or
information technology professional and want to become a data warehouse designer or administrator, this course will give
you the knowledge and skills to do that. By the end of the course, you will have the design experience, software
background, and organizational context that prepares you to succeed with data warehouse development projects.

In this course, you will create data warehouse designs and data integration workflows that satisfy the business
intelligence needs of organizations. When you’re done with this course, you’ll be able to:

* Evaluate an organization for data warehouse maturity and business architecture alignment;
* Create a data warehouse design and reflect on alternative design methodologies and design goals;
* Create data integration workflows using prominent open source software;
* Reflect on the role of change data, refresh constraints, refresh frequency trade-offs, and data quality goals in data
  integration process design; and
* Perform operations on pivot tables to satisfy typical business analysis requests using prominent open source software

### 3. Relational Database Support for Data Warehouses

In this course, you'll use analytical elements of SQL for
answering business intelligence questions. You'll learn features of relational database management systems for managing
summary data commonly used in business intelligence reporting. Because of the importance and difficulty of managing
implementations of data warehouses, we'll also delve into storage architectures, scalable parallel processing, data
governance, and big data impacts. In the assignments in this course, you can use either Oracle or PostgreSQL.

### 4. Business Intelligence Concepts, Tools, and Applications

In this course, you will gain the knowledge and skills
for using data warehouses for business intelligence purposes and for working as a business intelligence developer.
You’ll have the opportunity to work with large data sets in a data warehouse environment and will learn the use of
MicroStrategy's Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Visualization capabilities to create visualizations and
dashboards.

The course gives an overview of how business intelligence technologies can support decision making across any number of
business sectors. These technologies have had a profound impact on corporate strategy, performance, and competitiveness
and broadly encompass decision support systems, business intelligence systems, and visual analytics. Modules are
organized around the business intelligence concepts, tools, and applications, and the use of data warehouse for business
reporting and online analytical processing, for creating visualizations and dashboards, and for business performance
management and descriptive analytics.
